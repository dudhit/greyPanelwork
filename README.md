An SDDM-greeter theme
hope fully it doesn't look like half the clones @ the store.kde.org

after 3 years i was getting a bit bored of debian-maui
this is my first dive into qml while also trying not to rely on SddmComponents

there is still functionality missing (locales / keybords)
The theme I was using also seemed to omit many of the sleep APIs.
 not that i use them (not that they work on my setup)
turns out I've had to scrub code just to get this much working
